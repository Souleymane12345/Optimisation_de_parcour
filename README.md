# Optimisation_de_parcour

Implementation of a solution within the framework of route optimization using GPS data as part of the ESATIC 2021 hackathon.

In view of the instruction, the solution that I and my group have proposed is to use unsupervised learning where we had to use the scikitlearn library. 

From this library we used kmeans constraints then segment our dataset into 7 to have lent our dataset. 

Then we used to use a greedy type algorithms to search in our different clusters that we have each subdivided into 7 to have the smallest distance between the different points of us under cluster.

The directory is functional and the readme is being written.
